About
--------------------
Welcome and thank you for visiting! 

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt. My research interests lie in the intersection of Macro-Finance, International Finance and Banking. 
I am particulary interested in the role of banks (and banking regulation) and monetary policy for the foreign exchange markets and financial stabilty. Prior to starting my PhD, I studied at CEMFI, the University of Mannheim and Stockholm University and visited the Banco de Espa√±a and the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim.

This page contains information on my current and past research, teaching and personal background.  

If you have comments or suggestions for my research, please get in touch with me.
