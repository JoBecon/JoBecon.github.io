About

Welcome and thank you for visiting! 

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt. My research interests lie in the intersection of Macro-Finance, International Finance and Banking. 
I am particularyl interested in the role of banks (and banking regulation) for the foreign exchange markets.
